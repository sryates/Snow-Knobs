# Snow-Knobs
Voron 0 Kirigami Bed Knobs. The goal, to give the largest possible thumb wheels for easier leveling. 
We all know the Voron 0, it's a work horse a fantastic machine that can print almost every part for any other unit. 
But have you ever tried to level it I mean Really level it? My thumbs are killing me from it, and I tried store bought knobs but they all have a common factor;
They suck.
So to avoid this I went and created a mod using the stock build setup. Version 1 worked for the two back just fine but when it came to the front because of the cover
it was a tight fit, so I have increased the stem length it still uses heatsets.
