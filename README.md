# Snow-Knobs
Voron 0 Kirigami Bed Knobs. The goal, to give the largest possible thumb wheels for easier leveling. 
We all know the Voron 0, it's a work horse a fantastic machine that can print almost every part for any other unit. 
But have you ever tried to level it I mean Really level it? My thumbs are killing me from it, and I tried store bought knobs but they all have a common factor;
They suck.
So to avoid this I went and created a mod using the stock build setup. I created 4 versions for testing before reaching this one. I have tested and printed them please feel free to use them in your build, your thumbs will thank you.
